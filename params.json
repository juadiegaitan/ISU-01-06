All you need is the Anaconda distribution of python (which has scipy, numpy and matplotlib): https://www.continuum.io/downloads\r\nMac:\r\n\r\nSame as the Linux instructions. The native plain text editor isn't fantastic, so you may also want one, such as TextWrangler: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n\r\nYour job is unfortunately a little more involved. Install the Anaconda distribution of python linked above. If you have a UNIX/LINUX terminal emulator with which you're happy, then you don't need to install one. If you don't, or the previous sentence didn't make sense to you, install Git Bash: https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash\r\n\r\nIf you have a plain text editor with which you're happy, that's fine. If you need one, install BBEdit: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
